# Mindera Card Slider Challenge

The component displays a variable (configurable) number of cards, it can display up to the assigned number of cards and when the windows is resized it automatically displays the maximum number of cards up to the set value.

The card transition in during loading with an animated gradient overlay and with a scaling transformation upon rendering, so no broken loading state is showed.

It sports an infinite scroll both forward and backward.

Concurrently has been added so running ``npm start`` will both launch the api and the dev server.
